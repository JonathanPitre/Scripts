    <description>Java allows you to play online games, chat with people around the world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to name a few. It's also integral to the intranet applications and other e-business solutions that are the foundation of corporate computing. Please note you now need a Java License from Oracle to use unless installed for Personal Use and Development Use. 

### Note

This package installs the Java version offered at https://www.java.com. It also sets `SPONSORS=0`  ([see docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jre-installer-options.html#running)).

If you wish to only install the 32-bit version of Java use the /exclude parameter. The switch to exclude 32-bit is /exclude:32 and to exclude 64-bit /exclude:64 
For example: choco install jre8 -PackageParameters "/exclude:64" -y
This package no longer manually adds an environment variable. 
x86 installs of Windows you can expect to see an error while reading the registry, but the script will still function normally. 

This package can install 32-bit, 64-bit, or both versions. Find on [GitHub](https://github.com/JonathanPitre/Scripts/Chocolatey-Packages/jre8)</description>
